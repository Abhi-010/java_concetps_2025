1. Basic Filtering and Transformation
Given a List<String>, filter out strings that start with the letter "A" (case-sensitive) and 
convert the remaining strings to uppercase. Return the result as a List.
Focus: filter(), map(), collect().

2. Squaring and Summing
Given a List<Integer>, find the sum of the squares of all even numbers in the list.

Focus: filter(), mapToInt(), sum().

3. Flattening a Nested List
You have a List<List<Integer>>.
Write a stream to flatten this into a single List<Integer> containing all the numbers from the nested lists.

Focus: flatMap().

4. Find the Maximum Value
Given a List<Employee>, find the Employee object with the highest salary. If the list is empty, return an empty Optional.

Focus: max(), Comparator.comparingDouble().

5. Counting Occurrences (Frequency Map)
Given a String (e.g., "apple banana apple cherry"), split it by spaces and use streams to create a Map<String, Long> 
where the key is the word and the value is its frequency.
Focus: Collectors.groupingBy(), Collectors.counting().

6. Removing Duplicates and Sorting
Given an array of integers int[] nums = {5, 2, 8, 2, 5, 1}, return a sorted list of unique numbers.

Focus: Arrays.stream(), distinct(), sorted().

7. String Joining
Given a List<String> of names, create a single String that joins them all together, separated by a comma and a space, 
and enclosed in square brackets (e.g., "[John, Jane, Doe]").
Focus: Collectors.joining(delimiter, prefix, suffix).

8. Grouping by Property
Given a List<Student>, group the students by their "Grade" (e.g., A, B, C). The result should be a Map<String, List<Student>>.
Focus: Collectors.groupingBy().

9. Check for a Condition (Short-circuiting)
Given a List<Integer>, write a stream that returns true if all elements in the list are greater than 10.
Focus: allMatch().

10. Extracting Map Keys to a List
Given a Map<Integer, String> map, extract all the values (Strings) that correspond to an even key, and collect them into a List.
Focus: entrySet().stream(), filter(), map().

11. you have list<Employee>. find duplicates in the list for the employee which has same name.
